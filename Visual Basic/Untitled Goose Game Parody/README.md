A parody game of the Unitled Goose Game, made for a project in my A level Computer Science class. 
This was achieved using Window Forms App.NET in Visual Studio. 

Without the forms, it doesn't make much sense, but it demonstrates the breadth of coding that went into its creation. 

Oh, and the goose honks. And yes, that's one of my proudest coding achievements. 

Disclaimer - the variables reference zombies. We were allowed to adapt the premise of the program, on the conditions the variable 
names remained the same.
