This project was the final project for an Introduction to Object Orientated Programming class, using Java.
This program was designed to mimic a school food system with prepaid cards and different requirements depending on different dietary needs. 

The PoSDemo is the driver file. This displays a console to the user that allows them to see all cards, specific cards, list all cards with certain criteria, add, 
remove or update a card or add sales to a card.

PoS file establishes all methods relevant to the PoS class. 

PrePaidCard file establishes all methods related to the PrePaidCard class.
