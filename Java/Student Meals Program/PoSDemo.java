/*The purpose of the program is to create an interactive point of sale system that allows the user to update Point Of Sale objects. 
 * 
 * This file is the driver, and creates the interface of the program. The default PoS objects are hard coded in the beginning of main. 
 * 
 * The user is greeted with a welcome message and a menu is displayed with all of the options available to them. This operates within a while loop 
 * (while the user doesn't want to quit) and utilises a switch case to switch between menu options. This was the most appropriate construct as 
 * code will only be run when the user choices that option. This saves processing capacity, as compared to an if statement less intense comparisons 
 * are being made. 
 * 
 * More detail about these options will be provided below.*/
