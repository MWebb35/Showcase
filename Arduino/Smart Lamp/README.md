This project utilises an Arduino and ESP32 to control a custom circuit in order to make it into a smart device. The ESP32 hosts a web server that an external peripheral can connect to. On the webpage, the user has the option to press two buttons - "on" and "off". When a button is pressed, an integer signal (1 for on/0 for off) is sent to the Arduino via a level shifter which converts the signal from 3.3V to 5V. This is then interpreted by Arduino which writes HIGH or LOW to the digital pin (12) that the 5V dual channel relay is using. The relay then steps up the voltage to 230V and uses the signal to turn the lamp on or off. The relay acts as a switch for the lamp.
The circuit is powered by mains power and plugs into a standard wired plug socket. There is a 20 AMP double pole switch built into the circuit which allows for the lamp to still operate in the unlikely scenario that the Arduino, ESP32, or relay fails.
